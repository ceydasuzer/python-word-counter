# python-word-counter

### Introduction
Simple word counter console application I created with python. Project's aim was to create a console application that gets file name as input, then output the count of words in given file.

### Technologies
* Python 3.10

### How this project works?
* Application asks the user to enter file name as .txt file,
* Checks if the input ends with '.txt' and if the file exists
* Counts words in said file then outputs the word count
